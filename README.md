This repository contains a primarily viewable version of the virtual ROS
environment used for Project FUSED. If you want to run the fusion workflow
on recorded ROS bags, look into the demo environment linked below.

The main FUSED environment is located here:
https://github.com/ethanrogers15/project_fused

The ROS2 demo environment is located here: 
https://github.com/ethanrogers15/project_fused_ros_demo

The model training environment is located here:
https://github.com/ethanrogers15/mediapipe_model_maker

Because this environment requires the Royale SDK installed in the local
system, actually building the ROS environment and running the launch files
is difficult. So, this repository is primarily for viewing the code. The 
important files used for calibration, data recording, and workflow deployment
are located in the 'camera_combiner' directory under 'src'.
